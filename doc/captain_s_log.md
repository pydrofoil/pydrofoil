27.07.22
==

- participants: CF, JW, NR, LL
- installed tool chain for Nico and Lukas
- Modified nandtarget to generate code
- Modified Nand Make file to generate code, translate it to c and execute the c file

28.06.2022
==

- CF: fix equality implementation of basically everything, afterwards linux
  boots to completion

27.06.2022
==

- participants: CF
- managed to load linux and start the boot process, but there's a bug about a
  million instructions in

22.06.2022:
==
- participants: CF, JW, NR
- introdution to the whole stack of layers for Nico

21.06.2022:
==
- participants: CF
- optimization of bitvectors and integers by size specializing them into the
  64bit fast case and the general big bit vector case using rbigint
  
20.06.2022:
==
- participants: CF
- risc-v works translated, but some primitives are missing

19.06.2022
==
- participants: CF
- risc-v works untranslated

17.06.2022
==
- participants: CF
- parse RISC-V model
- progress on generating code for MIPS
- generate (not yet working) code for RISC-V


16.06.2022
==
- participants: CF, JW
- start some docs
- fixed warnings in nand2tetris
- hacked a jit for nand together, 300x faster than the C emulator
- added enough to the parser to parse MIPS


15.06.2022
==
- participants: CF, JW
- see console history log for setup
- nand 2 tetris (https://www.nand2tetris.org/) cpu case study works
- ocaml setup: ocamlInstallationGuide.pdf
- windows 10: disable sandbox https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54987110/
  installing-ocaml-on-windows-10-using-wsl-ubuntu-problems-with-bwrap-bubblewr
- tobin.py convert string (e.g.0000000000001010) repr to bytes (little endian)
- compile xxx.asm to xxx.hack using nand tools
  (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xZzcMIUETv3u3sdpM_oTJSTetpVee3KZ)
- cycle counter to solve endles loop problem of nand code
- RAM and ROM (nand hack cpu is a harvard architecture) using malloc and
  copy from bin file (generated by tobin.py)
- Warning: wrong casting (uint8, int64 e.g) caused problem in input parsing
- use printf of cpu state (PC, A, D, cycle) for now
